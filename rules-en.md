# Without Borders

**Designer: Vlaada Chvátil**

---

There are people who love to travel, and people who love to read about traveling.

Without Borders is an internet project that aims to bring these people together.

In this game, you become travelers for the Without Borders project. Your task is to visit new places and write articles about them for the website. The Without Borders project gives you a modest stipend for your journey, because the project is still in an experimental phase and dependent on government grants and tourism support.

You'll spend most of your stipend on traveling, but whatever you save is yours to keep. You probably won't get rich from the savings, but you might save up enough for the trip of your dreams.

---

## How to Start Playing Quickly

First, decide whether your first travels will take place on the map of Europe or the map of the United States of America. Then set up the game according to the picture on page 2.

The game is divided into **three parts of two rounds each** and a **final round** – seven rounds total. The individual parts differ slightly from each other, but players don't need to know the differences beforehand.

Simply read or explain the rules for the first part to the players, and you can immediately play the first two rounds of the game. Then read about what's different in the second part of the game and play the next two rounds. After that, learn the rules for the third part, which also has two rounds. Finally, explain and play the final round.

**The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.**

> _For your first game, you can choose the map that everyone knows better, but this isn't required. For the game, it's enough if players have just a basic idea of the map._

> _Each player has their own traveler card where they can track the progress of the game. The overview shows the rules and individual parts of the game._

> _You don't need to complicate your first game by explaining all the rules. It's enough to tell players what the goal of the game is. Each round, they must save as much as possible from their allocated grant._

---

## Game Setup

### Traveler Card and Tokens

Each player chooses one traveler card and two round tokens of the same color and places them in front of themselves on the table. The traveler card contains a game overview on one side and rules for evaluating journeys on the other.

> _It also reminds forgetful players which color is theirs when their tokens set off on their travels._

### Game Board

Place the game board in the middle of the table so that all players can comfortably reach it.

> _Be kind and push it a bit closer to the smaller ones with shorter arms._

### Game Money

Place the game money in an accessible location as the bank.

> _If you don't like anarchy where everyone "grabs" from the common fund as they please, you can choose a banker who will be responsible for distributing and receiving money during the game._

### Stones

Prepare four transparent stones. You'll need them for evaluating journeys.

### Country Cards

Each map has a corresponding set of cards with individual countries. Shuffle these cards and place them face down in front of one of the players. That player becomes the dealing player for the first round.

> _Who becomes the dealing player doesn't have much impact on the game, so let's leave this choice as a privilege for whoever was kind enough to shuffle the cards._

### Map

Show players the chosen map and point out its specifics. Especially that island nations are connected by lines across the sea. For game purposes: **two countries connected by a line across the sea are considered to share a common border**. A detailed description of both maps can be found on the back of the rules.

Then fold the map and set it aside for now. **During the game, the map is hidden from players and is only used during evaluation.**

> _Some players might panic at this point. Calm them down – they don't need to know the map precisely. On the contrary, opinions like "South Dakota... that must be somewhere in the south..." make the game more fun and entertaining._

### Other Components

Put the other map and its corresponding cards in the box; you won't need them for now.

> _Unless someone says right after the game ends: "That was great, shall we try the other map?"_

---

## First Part of the Game (Rounds 1–2)

### Receiving Money

At the beginning of the first part, **each player receives 100 euros**. This money is for the first and second rounds. You won't receive more money until the beginning of the third round.

> _The Without Borders season begins every year at the end of winter, with the allocation of the first money and the announcement of the first two rounds of the project._

### First and Second Round

#### Publishing the Offer

Each round of the game is started by the dealing player. They rotate the game board so that the **40** space is closest to them. Then they take the country cards and start dealing them **face up onto the other seven spaces** around the edge of the game board, clockwise from the 40 space, creating an offer of seven countries.

Immediately after filling all seven spaces, they place **the eighth card face up in the center of the game board**. This card is called the **starting country card**. Once it's revealed, players choose their destinations.

> _Each round of the project begins with the publication of sponsor countries on the project website. One country is always the main sponsor and becomes the so-called starting country, and seven other countries form the offer for that round._

> _All project participants are invited to visit the starting country. From the offered countries, they can then choose one more to visit._

#### Choosing Destinations

Once the starting card is on the board, all players (including the dealing player) simultaneously pick up **one of their round tokens** and place it next to any space on the game board (next to one of the cards in the offer or next to the 40 space), in the cutout area of the game board.

- **During card dealing, players' tokens lie on the table.** Players may not touch them. They may only pick up a token the moment the starting country card is revealed.
- Players place tokens **simultaneously**. It's up to them how quickly they decide and place their token.
- A player may choose a space where one or more tokens placed by other players already lie – in that case, they place their token on top of the previously placed tokens. **Tokens can therefore form a stack at one space**, with the token of the player who chose the card and placed their token fastest at the bottom.
- In the first rounds, **players place only one** of their two tokens. The second token remains unused for now.
- Once placed, a player may not move their token. They cannot change their decision.

When placing tokens, players try to choose from the seven countries one that they can reach from the starting country (whose card lies in the center of the game board) with **as few border crossings as possible**. However, they avoid countries that directly border the starting country (share a common border).

They also try to be as fast as possible, because with each token placed at a country earlier, the country becomes less advantageous.

> _Why, you'll see in the Evaluation chapter. The project rules are set up so that you travel a bit, but also don't spend unnecessarily too much._

> _You know, the best options are often taken as soon as the offer is published on the project website._

A player may also place their token at **space 40**. This indicates they're not interested in any of the countries. They usually do this when they decide the available countries are too disadvantageous or there are already too many tokens on them. Multiple tokens can also be at this space, and it's also less advantageous here if you place your token on previously placed tokens.

> _Sometimes you'd simply rather return part of the grant than pay for the trip out of your own pocket._

**Remember that during this phase, the map is hidden and players may not look at it.**

> _Variant: If you're playing with younger children who don't even have a rough idea of the map, you can leave the map uncovered for their first games. You'll be surprised how quickly they'll learn it. Soon they'll be able to play with the map covered too. And in geography class, they'll be stars!_

> _If everyone else has already placed their tokens, it's polite not to delay too much and choose as soon as possible... so everyone can set off on their travels._

#### Evaluation

Once everyone has placed their token, evaluation begins. For this, you'll need the map – place it so all players can see it.

Take one of the colored stones and place it on the starting country on the map. Then progressively select one player after another (preferably choose those whose token isn't covered by other tokens) and place a clear stone in the country that player chose.

Now calculate how much the player spent on their journey. Each player can choose their own route to make it cost as little as possible.

> _To speed up the game, others can help find the optimal route, but they shouldn't intentionally give bad advice._

> _Some countries are so small that the stone covers them entirely. But it's transparent, so you actually have the country in the stone, instead of the stone in the country._

**The rules for determining the price are on the back of the help card:**

| Cost    | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **-10** | Each **border crossing** costs the player 10 euros. A crossing means crossing the border between neighboring countries or moving along a marked line across the sea.                                                                           |
| **-30** | If the player chose a country that **directly borders** the starting country, they pay an additional 30 euro surcharge (regardless of which route they want to take). Again – countries connected by a sea line are also considered neighbors. |
| **-10** | Additionally, the player pays a surcharge of **10 euros for each token lying under their token**.                                                                                                                                              |
| **40**  | If the player placed their token at space 40, they don't travel anywhere. They pay only the indicated **40 euros**, plus 10 euros for each token lying under their token.                                                                      |

> _So it doesn't matter how far you go, only how many borders you cross. From Azerbaijan to Norway is cheaper than you'd expect._

> _You received money to travel across the world. If you just want to stay in place, you'll have to return part of it._

> _Whoever clicks first, travels first – or at least travels cheaper._

> _Want to enjoy the starting country instead of traveling? Fine, but return part of the grant..._

The player **pays the resulting price to the bank**. (If they don't have the full amount, they pay only as much as they have.)

After calculating and paying the price, return the token to its player. Continue with the next player until you've progressively evaluated everyone.

We recommend always evaluating first the players whose tokens lie on top of other players' tokens, so you don't forget any surcharges. After evaluating the last player, the round ends and a new one can begin.

#### Example

The starting country was France. Players placed their tokens as shown in the picture. Open the map of Europe to see how they did.

- **Red** travels to Great Britain. The sea connection counts as only one border crossing (10 euros), but additionally they pay 30 euros because France and Great Britain are neighbors. Total: **40 euros**.
- **Yellow, Blue, and Purple** travel to Hungary, which is three border crossings. Purple pays **50 euros** – there are two more tokens under theirs. Blue pays **40 euros** – there's one more token under theirs. Yellow pays **30 euros**.
- **Green and White** placed their tokens at space 40. They don't travel anywhere. White pays **50 euros** – standing on another token. Green pays **40 euros**.

> _There was another good choice in the country offer that nobody noticed. Greece looks far away, but through Italy and Malta you can also reach it in three border crossings._

### End of Round

This ends the round. If players are interested, you can look up the country that was the starting country this round in the included country descriptions and read some interesting facts about it. Among other things, you'll learn what's actually in the picture on the card.

> _Since you've all visited that country, you might as well take away some knowledge from your virtual journey!_

After evaluation ends, **close the map again**. Set aside the cards from the offer, including the starting country, on a separate pile (face up, so they don't get mixed up). You won't need them until the seventh round.

**The dealing player passes the pile to the player on their left** – they become the new dealing player for the next round.

The second round proceeds the same as the first. **However, you don't receive any additional money** – you only have what remained from the first round. If you still have some money left after the second round, that's good for you; you keep it for the following rounds.

> _If you have nothing left after the second round, that's okay. At least you have the good feeling that you used the money you received and traveled nicely._

---

**If you've reached this point while reading or explaining the rules, you don't need to read further. Play the first two rounds of the game.**

---

## Second Part of the Game (Rounds 3–4)

> _Spring is in full swing and the second part of the project is starting – the third and fourth rounds. The grant is bigger this time, and your journeys will be longer too._

### Receiving Money

At the beginning of the second part of the game, **each player receives 200 euros**. They add this to any amount remaining from the first two rounds. Together, this forms their cash for the third and fourth rounds.

### Third and Fourth Round

#### Publishing the Offer

Laying out country cards in the second part proceeds the same as in the first part.

#### Choosing Destinations

This time, players' task is to **place both of their tokens at two different spaces** on the game board. The player will travel from the starting country first to one, then to the other country they mark with their tokens. Again, they try to cross as few borders as possible on their journey, while ensuring no two countries directly border each other.

- Players may place tokens **with only one hand, and sequentially**. They may pick up the second only after placing the first.
- Once placed, you may not take back or move a token, regardless of whether you've already placed your second token or not.
- **A player's tokens may not be at the same space.**
- The phase ends when everyone has placed both their tokens.

> _Remember that while the dealing player is laying out cards, both your tokens lie on the table._

> _So tokens can be at two different countries, or at one country and at space 40._

#### Evaluation

For evaluation, you'll need one colored stone (to mark the starting country) and two transparent ones (to mark the countries the currently evaluated player chose).

To determine the price, start at the starting country and progressively visit one, then the other chosen country. **Each player chooses the order in which they visit their chosen countries**, and this happens during evaluation (to make it as advantageous as possible for them).

You calculate the journey price using the same rules as in the first round. The only clarification concerns neighboring countries:

| Cost        | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **-30 -30** | For chosen countries **that border each other**, the player pays a 30 euro surcharge. For each chosen country that **directly borders the starting country**, the player pays a 30 euro surcharge. |

It doesn't matter which route they take or in what order they visit the chosen countries. **The surcharge is paid because the countries are neighbors**, not because they're next to each other on their route.

> _So in total, you can pay up to 90 euros in penalties._

If the player placed one of their tokens at **space 40**, they travel from the starting country **only to the country where they placed their other token**. 40 euros is added to the price of this journey (or more if their token isn't first at space 40).

> _Start with players whose tokens aren't covered by others. If that's not possible, evaluate someone with one token covered, but don't remove the covered token yet._

#### Example

The starting country is France. Blue chose Great Britain and the Netherlands. The journey price is **80 euros**. 20 euros for crossing two borders and 60 euros surcharge for neighboring countries (Great Britain borders both France and the Netherlands). Blue couldn't avoid the surcharge by choosing a longer route (for example, from France to Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, and Great Britain).

It's still better than if they had chosen Belgium instead of the Netherlands, where the surcharge would be 90 euros and the total price would be 110 euros.

---

**You can play the second part of the game.**

---

## Third Part of the Game (Rounds 5–6)

> _In summer, the most prestigious part of the project takes place – with the largest grant and truly long journeys._

### Receiving Money

At the beginning of the third part of the game, **each player receives 300 euros** and adds this to any amount remaining from the first four rounds.

### Fifth and Sixth Round

#### Publishing the Offer

Card dealing proceeds similarly to the first four rounds. The next player in order takes their turn. However, instead of one card, the dealing player places **two cards in the center of the game board** – the **starting and destination countries**. It doesn't matter which country is the starting and which is the destination; the journey will cost the same in both directions. So they deal nine cards total – seven around the edge and two in the center of the board.

The dealing player chooses the pace of laying out cards around the edge. However, make sure to lay out the starting and destination countries **as simultaneously as possible** or with minimal time difference.

#### Choosing Destinations

Selection proceeds according to the same rules as in the third and fourth rounds. Players progressively place both their tokens at two different spaces on the game board.

This time, the player will travel **from one of the two revealed countries to the other**, passing through both chosen countries. Again, they try to make the journey as cheap as possible and ensure countries don't border each other.

#### Evaluation

Proceeds similarly to the previous two rounds. Mark the starting and destination countries with two colored stones; place two clear ones on the countries the player chose.

The player must choose a route from one of the starting/destination country pair (it doesn't matter which – the journey costs the same in both directions) to the other. **They must pass through both chosen countries.** The price is determined the same as in the previous round, to be as low as possible:

| Cost        | Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **-30 -30** | Again, a 30 euro surcharge is paid for each neighboring pair of starting/destination and chosen country, or if both chosen countries are neighbors. **However, no surcharge is paid for any adjacency between the starting and destination countries.** |
| **40**      | If the player placed one token at space 40, they lead the route from the starting to the destination country **only through the country where they placed their other token**, but pay an additional 40 euros.                                          |

> _So in this round, the traveler can pay up to 150 euros in penalties for neighboring countries._

---

**You can play the third part of the game.**

---

## Finale (Round 7)

> _The fall round is a kind of reward for all faithful project participants. They can plan the journey of their dreams. Needless to say, interest suddenly shifts toward distant and expensive journeys._

The game ends with the last, seventh round. This time, **you don't receive any money in advance**, but you also **won't pay any money**. On the contrary, you'll receive a grant equal to how expensive a journey you plan.

### Seventh Round

#### Dealing

The country cards lasted for the six previous rounds. Before the last round, the dealing player takes all used cards and shuffles them. Any country can appear in the last round.

Dealing proceeds the same as in the third part (rounds 5 and 6). Seven countries go into the offer, then quickly lay out two more cards in the center – the starting and destination countries.

#### Choosing Destinations

Destination selection also looks the same as in the third part. Players place two tokens at two different spaces. They'll travel from the starting country to the destination country through their two chosen countries.

**This time, players don't try for the cheapest journey. They want to place their tokens so the journey is as long and expensive as possible.** This time you won't pay the journey price; instead, you'll receive money equal to its value.

> _So in the destination selection phase, the player tries to place their tokens so that the cheapest route through them is as expensive as possible. However, the route itself, including the order of visited countries, is chosen by opponents._

> _It's a bonus for not burdening the project treasury too much with your traveling. Once those grants are announced, they simply have to be distributed._

#### Evaluation

All players are progressively evaluated as in previous rounds. Mark the starting and destination countries with two colored stones; the two clear ones are for the countries the player chose.

We're again looking for a route from one of the starting/destination country pair to the other that passes through both chosen countries. **This time, the route is chosen not by the player who selected the countries, but collectively by all other players.** They try to find a route that will be as cheap as possible under the given conditions.

The journey price is determined similarly to the third part of the game:

- The player **receives 10 euros for each border** they cross.
- The price again **increases by 30 euros for each neighboring pair** of countries (but not for adjacency between the starting and destination countries).
- Placing a token at space 40 also means the player **adds 40 euros** to the journey price through the country chosen with their other token.
- However, this time the price **decreases by 10 euros for each token** lying under either of their tokens.

> _So even in the seventh round, it's disadvantageous to be slower than others._

---

## End of Game

The game ends after the seventh round. Players count their money (saved during the first six rounds and earned in the seventh round).

**Whoever has the highest amount wins.** Alternatively, all players who earned the most money are winners. So there can be multiple winners.

> _That's not entirely true. This game is about traveling and learning, so really everyone who enjoyed it and maybe learned something new has won._

---

## More Challenging Variant for Two or Three Players

If only two or three players are playing, you can try a more challenging variant. Each player takes **two traveler cards and both tokens from both chosen colors**.

> _With regular rules, the game with fewer players is easier – there are fewer tokens in the game, and good choices often remain available even for players who don't hurry._

### Receiving Money

The player receives income for both traveler cards, so **200, 400, and 600 euros** in the respective parts.

> _Both of the player's travelers share a common money pile. Cash is shared for both colors. So one color can spend more than 100 euros in the first part._

### Choosing Destinations

Players play both colors simultaneously. They place tokens again sequentially and with only one hand. The player chooses the order themselves.

**However, they must choose different destinations for each color.** In the first part, when players place two tokens (one from each color), each must go to a different space.

In the second and third parts and in the final round, everyone places four tokens (two from each color). They may not choose exactly the same pair of spaces for both colors; at least one token from each color must go to different spaces.

> _So a player may place one token from each color at one space, but the remaining two tokens must then each go to different spaces._

### Evaluation

Players evaluate both their colors separately. The 10 euro surcharge for a token placed earlier at the same space is paid even for a token of the allied color.

For each color, the player pays (in the seventh round, receives) the calculated amount.

### Incorrectly Placed Tokens

If a player accidentally places tokens of both colors the same way, proceed as follows when this is discovered:

- If the player was placing two tokens in the first and second rounds and placed them at the same space, they must take the bottom one and place it again in accordance with the rules.
- Proceed the same way if a player places both tokens of the same color at one space (this can also happen in the basic variant of the game).
- If they were placing four tokens (in rounds three through seven) and placed them in pairs at the same spaces, they must take both their bottom tokens and place them again in accordance with the rules.

> _One of them can even go back to the original position (on top of the stack at the same space), but in that case the other must go elsewhere._

---

## Map Descriptions

### Europe

The map has several connections across the sea. Before the game, it's good to show players the map and mention these adjacencies. Only those connections were included that connect independent islands to one to three nearest countries, regardless of actual sea lines or ferries.

- For example, Poland doesn't border Sweden, Denmark doesn't border Norway, Italy doesn't border Spain, etc., even though you'd probably find direct sea connections between these countries in reality.

Where countries or common borders are too small, the size ratios on the map were slightly adjusted compared to reality so everything is apparent at first glance. Note especially that:

- **Croatia** directly borders Montenegro, but not Italy.
- **Liechtenstein** borders Austria and Switzerland, but not Italy and Germany.
- **Monaco** is completely surrounded by France and doesn't directly border Italy.

Countries are considered contiguous even when they consist of multiple islands and mainland parts:

- **Denmark** directly borders Sweden (connected by the Øresund Bridge).
- **Greece** with all its islands is considered a contiguous country and borders Turkey and Malta (by sea).
- **Great Britain** borders Ireland (Northern Ireland is part of Great Britain).
- **Iceland** borders Ireland, United Kingdom, and Norway (by sea).
- **Malta** borders Italy and Greece (by sea).
- **Cyprus** borders Turkey (by sea).

#### Special Case: Russia

- Russia also has a small part (Kaliningrad) between Poland and Lithuania. **For travel purposes, both parts are considered separate countries.** If you enter one part of Russia, you must continue to a country that borders that same part of Russia.
- If you have Russia as your starting, destination, or one of your chosen countries, you can choose either part.
- **However, for penalty purposes, neighboring countries are considered those bordering both parts**, regardless of which part you actually visit when traveling.

**Example:** In the first round, the starting country is Poland. The green player chooses Russia. The journey costs them 40 euros – from Poland they can reach the smaller part of Russia in one border crossing, but they pay an additional 30 euros because the countries are neighbors. Even if they chose the route Poland–Belarus–Russia (large part), it wouldn't help, because Russia and Poland are neighbors regardless of which part they choose – the journey would cost 50 euros.

The red player chooses Finland. The shortest route costs 30 euros – through Belarus and the large part of Russia. The shorter route Poland–Russia–Finland isn't possible because Poland borders a different part of Russia than Finland.

**Azerbaijan** has a similar anomaly to Russia – its smaller part borders Turkey but not Russia, its larger part borders Russia but not Turkey.

#### Countries Inside Other Countries

Some countries are located inside other countries. If your task is to pass through such a country, you must cross the border both when entering and when leaving: you'll visit the surrounding country twice.

**Example:** In the third round, the starting country is Italy. The yellow player chose Monaco and Spain. The journey will cost them 40 euros – from Italy they first go to France, then to Monaco, then back to France, and finally to Spain. It's actually just as expensive as if they visited the countries in the opposite order (Italy–France–Spain–France–Monaco).

### USA

The USA map is fairly straightforward. Just note:

- The states **Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico** all border each other, so you can go directly from Utah to New Mexico or from Arizona to Colorado.
- There are only **two sea connections** on the map: Alaska to Washington and Hawaii to California. All other states border only through land borders.
- **Michigan** borders Wisconsin, but not Minnesota. Both parts of Michigan are considered contiguous territory.
- **Connecticut** doesn't border New Jersey.
- **Maine** doesn't border Massachusetts.
